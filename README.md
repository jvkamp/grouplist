# GroupList
## The collaborative list app. 

A work in progress. 
GroupList allows you to create private or public lists to keep track of everything from to-do items and reminders, to shopping lists.
You can be part of various groups (roommates, coworkers, family, friends) that can create shared lists between them. 
Lists can be shared with other individuals as well! 
Someone not connected to a group can be added to a list that is shared between a group, or it can be kept between you and the other person. 
Changes to shared lists will update live for all the connected people. 
You can also keep private lists that cannot be seen by anyone else. If you want to share them, you can! 
As the creator of a list you can add and remove access to it.
